## Getting started
Before you fill in this template check if the proposed UI block -component or pattern, already exists [here](https://coda.io/d/Design-System-Database_dNyzE_TLZDh/per-Tier_suu2dwwx#UI-Blocks-per-Tier_tus7JmYw). 


A component in Pragma needs to be flexible enough that it can be used across a wide range of scenarios and shouldn't be constrained to a specific number of applications.

## Visual

Provide a screenshot or link to a prototype of your UI block proposal.

## Context

Where and when might this proposed UI block be used?

## State

Does this UI block have state? If so, what are the different states (e.g. accordion with closed/open states)?

## Progressive enhancement

A UI block should be designed small screen first. How does this scale up?
How will this degrade on less competent browsers?
