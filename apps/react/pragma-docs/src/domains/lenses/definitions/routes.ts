/**
 * The Definitions lens routes (P-5): the explorer (`/definitions`, the
 * lens key the Rail links to) and the term view (`/definitions/:term`,
 * percent-encoded prefixed URI, e.g. `/definitions/ds%3AUIBlock`). Both
 * mount the same page over the same ONE `RouteQueryEntry`
 * (`definitionsQuery.ts`), parked twice per the P-2/P-5 handshake:
 *
 * - `meta[ROUTE_QUERY_META_KEY]` — the server prepare step executes the
 *   query in-process and serialises the store (`prepareRelayData`);
 * - `prefetch` — hover (router-react's `Link`) and the initial hydration
 *   load warm the client store through `warmRouteQuery`.
 *
 * Both routes claim ALL THREE mode-strip sockets (R5 — a toolbar and the
 * top bar should be useful): the context name, the filter chips, and the
 * status figure. The chips filter on the two axes an `OntologyClass`
 * genuinely carries — abstraction and owning ontology. They are NOT a
 * maturity lens: verified live, the ontology surface has no lifecycle,
 * status or channel field, and the `Tag` vocabulary that does carry a
 * channel facet applies to UIBlocks rather than ontology classes.
 *
 * Claiming the sockets deliberately loosened `frameStability.tests.tsx`,
 * which previously asserted both were empty on every URL; that change
 * landed in its own commit with its own justification.
