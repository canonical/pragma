# Baseline Grid Addon

Storybook addon that overlays an 8px baseline grid on stories. Verify that typography, spacing, and component dimensions align to the design system's vertical rhythm.

## Usage

Toggle the grid using the toolbar icon (grid symbol). The overlay appears on all stories and persists across navigation.

## What to Verify

| Element | Expected Alignment |
|---------|-------------------|
| Text baselines | Land on grid lines |
| Line heights | Multiples of 8px |
| Vertical padding | Multiples of 8px |
| Vertical margins | Multiples of 8px |
| Component heights | Multiples of 8px when possible |

Small optical adjustments (1-2px) are acceptable when they improve perceived alignment.

## Configuration

The addon works out of the box with `@canonical/storybook-config`. To customize:

```ts
// .storybook/preview.ts
export const parameters = {
  baselineGrid: {
    gridSize: 8,
    gridColor: "cyan",
    gridOpacity: 0.15,
  },
};
```

## Per-Story Control

Disable the grid for specific stories:

```ts
export const MyStory: Story = {
  parameters: {
    baselineGrid: { disable: true },
  },
};
```

## Why 8px?

The 8px grid provides:

- **Consistency** — Predictable spacing relationships
- **Scalability** — Divides evenly at common sizes (16, 24, 32, 48)
- **Screen compatibility** — Aligns well with device pixel ratios
