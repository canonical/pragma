# Architecture

pragma is built on one idea: **one grammar, many projections.** A single declarative description of every capability is projected into a CLI, an MCP server, a machine-readable surface covenant, and this documentation. Nothing is hand-wired twice, so the surfaces cannot drift.

## Layers

### Kernel — the grammar and its projections

Every capability is a `VerbSpec`: a `path` (`[noun]` or `[noun, verb]`), a summary and doc, typed `params`, output formatters, a `capability` profile (store / mutation / MCP exposure), and a `run` body. The grammar is the single source of truth; a set of pure, zod-free projectors read it:

- **`emitSurface`** — freezes the machine-readable surface covenant (tool set, flags, envelope, exit codes) that conformance tests protect.
- **`registerVerb`** — adapts a verb into an MCP tool: it builds the zod input schema, derives annotations, and wraps a mutation in the plan-first `confirm` flow.
- **`emitReference`** — projects the grammar into the Markdown [reference](./reference/index.md) (a sibling of `emitSurface`; the build writes it back and a drift-guard pins it).

Keeping the projectors pure and zod-free is what lets `--help` and shell completion stay on a fast path that never boots the store.

### Store — the design-system knowledge graph

The read capabilities query a local, content-addressed graph. `pragma sources update` resolves each configured package (git, file, or npm), builds one [oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph)-backed pack, and writes `pragma.lock.json`. Later boots load from the lock with no network access.

At runtime a **`LazyStore`** boots the graph on first use and memoizes it. A storeless verb (`config show`, `doctor`, `sources status`, `capabilities`) never reaches the store factory, so the storeless guarantee holds by construction rather than by convention.

### Capabilities — the catalog

The concrete verbs live under `src/capabilities/` as `CapabilityModule`s, collected into one ordered array. Some modules are hand-written (`block list`, the config setters); most read nouns compile from declarative *packs*. The projectors consume this one array — add a module and it appears in the CLI, the MCP server, and the generated reference at once.

### Frontends — CLI and MCP

Two thin frontends turn the grammar into runnable surfaces:

- **CLI** — `buildProgram` wires the grammar into a Commander program; `dispatch` runs the resolved verb across the effect seam (a read is plain async; a mutation returns a `Task` interpreted under the node / dry-run / undo interpreters) and renders the outcome.
- **MCP** — `buildServer` registers every exposed verb via `registerVerb`, installs the resource and prompt surfaces, and attaches the handshake instructions.

Both frontends resolve configuration through the same **config seam** — the three-layer resolver described in [config-model.md](./config-model.md) — so the CLI and the MCP server always agree on the active tier, channel, and package sources.

## The effect seam

Mutations never touch the filesystem directly. A mutating `run` returns a `Task` — a description of its effects — which the frontend interprets. The CLI interprets it under `--dry-run` (describe only), `--undo` (reverse), or real execution; the MCP handler interprets it as a plan unless `confirm: true`. One Task description, several interpreters — the reason `--dry-run` and MCP's plan-first preview share exactly one code path.
