# MCP tool reference

Every tool the pragma MCP server exposes, plus its non-tool surface. Generated from the live capability grammar — do not edit by hand.

Mutating tools are plan-first: called without `confirm: true` they return the plan they WOULD apply; called with `confirm: true` they execute. A mutating tool also accepts an optional absolute `cwd`.

### block_list

List design system blocks visible under the active tier chain and channel. Optionally list across every tier, ignoring the tier filter.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allTiers` | boolean | no | Show blocks from all tiers, ignoring the tier filter. |

### block_lookup

Get detailed information about one or more design system blocks including anatomy, modifiers, and properties. Use when you need the full spec of specific blocks by name — detail: "summary" trims to the base view. Example: block_lookup { names: ["Button"] }.

Read-only.

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string[] | yes | Block names, prefixed names/IRIs, or glob patterns. |
| `detail` | enum(summary, standard, detailed) | no | Progressive-disclosure level (default detailed). |

### block_sample

Return randomly selected complete design-system blocks as exemplars. Use BEFORE writing queries to see actual data shapes, anatomy, and property names.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### capabilities

Storeless orientation for agents. Returns the conventions (KG / tier-channel / SPARQL model), a four-stage discovery sequence, and every live tool with a behavioural use_when hint and category — all derived from the live grammar, so it never drifts. Call it first at session start.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### colophon

Storeless — a colophon for the toolchain. Prints pragma's own story (the effect monad, one-grammar-many-projections, the render/LLM-output model, storeless modularity, and the domain-as-data pack model) followed by the active pack's domain colophon. Also available as a condensed Markdown narration for agents, or as a structured JSON projection of the sections.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

### config_set

Write a global config field by name — the one-command form of the per-field setters. `key` is one of `tier`, `channel`, or `detail`; the field's own reset rules apply (e.g. `set tier none` clears it). Written to the global layer only — project configs are authored by hand.

Mutation — plan-first (set `confirm: true` to apply).

**Input**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | enum(tier, channel, detail) | yes | The config field to write. (one of: tier, channel, detail) |
| `value` | string | yes | The value to write (or a field's reset sentinel, e.g. `none`). |
| `confirm` | boolean | no | Set true to execute; otherwise a plan is returned (default false). |
| `cwd` | string | no | Absolute project directory to write into; defaults to the server's working directory. |

### config_show

Merges built-in defaults, the global XDG config, and the nearest pragma.config.ts, marking which layer supplied each value.

Read-only.

**Input**

_No input parameters._

## Non-tool surface

- **Resources**: `pragma:{+uri}` — entity reads addressed by URI (listing and autocomplete are storeless over the pack index).
- **Prompts**: the design system's workflow templates are offered natively over `prompts/list` and `prompts/get`, and as the `prompt_list` / `prompt_lookup` content tools.
- **Instructions**: the server always sends handshake instructions describing the conventions and the discovery sequence.
