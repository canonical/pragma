## Pragma Ontology

This package contains [RDF Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) files that define the ontology used in Pragma.

Each file in [`src/`](./src/) corresponds to a specific namespace in the ontology. The files are organized as follows:

- [`CodeStandard.ttl`](./src/CodeStandard.ttl): Defines the `cs:` namespace, which includes classes and properties related to code standards.
