/**
 * Validates a rule against a project path.
 * Determines whether the rule is a file or directory rule and delegates
 * to the appropriate validation logic.
 *
 * @param projectPath - Absolute or relative path to the project directory to validate
 * @param rule - Rule object containing either file or directory validation specification
 * @param ruleName - Name of the rule for error reporting
 * @returns Promise that resolves to an array of validation results
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const rule = {
 *   file: { name: "package.json", contains: {...} }
 * };
 * const results = await validateRule("/path/to/project", rule, "package-config");
 * ```
