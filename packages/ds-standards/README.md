## Pragma Standards

This package contains [RDF Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) files that establish standards for Pragma, following the ontology defined in the [ontology package](../ds-ontology/README.md).

Each file in [`src/`](./src/) corresponds to a specific domain of standards. The files are organized as follows:

- [`Code.ttl`](./src/Code.ttl) - Universal coding standards that apply across all programming contexts
- [`Icons.ttl`](./src/Icons.ttl) - Standards for creating and maintaining the design system's icon set
- [`React.ttl`](./src/React.ttl) - Standards specific to React component development and architecture
- [`Styling.ttl`](./src/Styling.ttl) - Standards for implementing the design system's visual language in CSS
