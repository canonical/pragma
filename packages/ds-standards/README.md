## Pragma Standards

This package contains [RDF Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) files that establish standards for Pragma, following the ontology defined in the [ontology package](../ds-ontology/README.md).

Each file in [`src/`](./src/) corresponds to a specific domain of standards. The files are organized as follows:

- [`icons.ttl`](src/icons.ttl) - Standards for definition and usage of icons.
- [`styling.ttl`](src/styling.ttl) - Standards for structuring and usage of styling (CSS)
