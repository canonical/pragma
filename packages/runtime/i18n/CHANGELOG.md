# [0.42.0](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/compare/v0.41.0...v0.42.0) (2026-09-28)

* chore(monorepo)!: move to TypeScript 7 (#1374) ([713d307](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/commit/713d3071d3980539a849ea95823736e8b343a1b1)), closes [#1374](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/1374) [#lib](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/lib) [#domains](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/domains) [#i18n](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/i18n) [#relay](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/relay) [#styles](https://github.com/canonical/pragma/issues/styles)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* the shared TypeScript configs, storybook-config,
  vitest-config-react and styles-typography no longer accept TypeScript 5 as
  a peer, and the tsconfig presets no longer set or expect baseUrl.

  * chore(configs): keep TypeScript 5.9 and 6 in the typescript peer ranges

  The shared configs, the Storybook config, the Vitest React config and
  @canonical/typography now accept TypeScript ^5.9.3 || ^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0,
  so consumers still on 5.9 or 6 are not pushed off by this upgrade. The
  Svelte config keeps ^5.9.3 || ^6.0.0, because its consumers compile
  declarations with TypeScript 6.

  * chore(boilerplate-vite,summon-application): drop the tsconfig paths for # imports
