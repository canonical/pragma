# @canonical/svelte-ds-app-launchpad

Launchpad-specific components for the Pragma design system. This package provides Svelte UI components for the Launchpad application.

## Installation

```bash
bun add @canonical/svelte-ds-app-launchpad
```

## Usage

```typescript
<script lang="ts">
  import { Example } from "@canonical/svelte-ds-app-launchpad";
</script>

<Example />
```

## Development

**Note:** Testing requires Playwright; see the [Testing](#testing) section below.

```bash
# Run checks
bun run check

# Run tests
bun run test
```

To run the full test suite (temporary workaround until Playwright is supported in Pragma):

```bash
bun run test:client && bun run test:ssr && bun run test:server
```

### Testing

Tests use **Vitest browser mode**, which requires **Playwright**. This setup is currently **experimental in Pragma**.

One-time setup (install Playwright browsers):

```bash
bunx playwright install
```
