## Canonical Design System - React Core - Architecture

A guide to understand the design principles, key components, and technologies used in the core React component library.

This document is primarily focused on providing a clear explanation of the architecture for users who
want to understand the 'why' and 'how' behind its structure and design.

## 1. Explanation: Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Core Goals and Design Principles

Our architecture is driven by several core goals and design principles:

* **Simplicity:** The design system aims to provide a simple and clear structure that is easy to understand and use.
  This simplicity encompasses component code, APIs, documentation, and the overall development experience.
* **Reusability:** The primary goal is to create a library of reusable React components. These components are
  designed to be building blocks for various applications, promoting consistency and efficiency in development.
* **Performance:** Performance is a key consideration in the design system. Components and tooling optimized for speed
  and
  efficiency, ensuring that they perform well in production and development environments.
* **Accessibility:** Accessibility is a fundamental principle of the design system. Components aim to achieve WCAG 2.2
  AA compliance by default, ensuring that they are usable by all users.
* **Modernity:**  The library embraces forward-looking technologies and processes to provide a modern
  development experience.

### 1.2 Tooling Choices

On top of the [root-level architecture](../../../guides/ARCHITECTURE.md), this package leverages a modern React
toolchain to achieve its goals:

| Tool(s)                                | Enables                                                                     | Benefits                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [React 19](https://react.dev)          | Latest features, performance, and broad ecosystem compatibility             | Improved functionality, efficiency, and access to a wide range of libraries and tools |
| [Vite](https://vite.dev)               | Fast development server, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and optimized builds | Quick dev feedback loops, faster loading times, and improved performance              |
| [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) | Isolated component development and living style guide with documentation    | Focused development and testing, centralized and interactive documentation            |

### 1.3 Component-Based Structure

This package is organized around a component-based architecture. The core components reside within the `src/ui/`
directory.
This offers several advantages:

* **Modularity and Reusability:** Components are self-contained and designed for reuse across different parts of an
  application or across multiple projects. This modularity reduces code duplication and promotes consistency.
* **Encapsulation and Maintainability:** Each component encapsulates its logic, styling, and tests, making it easier to
  maintain and update individual components without causing ripple effects across the entire library.
* **Composition and Flexibility:** Complex user interfaces can be constructed by composing simpler components. This
  compositional approach provides flexibility and allows developers to build a wide range of UIs using the provided
  building blocks.
