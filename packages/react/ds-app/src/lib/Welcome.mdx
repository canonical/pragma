# Application Components — React

While Global tier provides atoms, Apps tier provides molecules and organisms — the larger structural pieces that define how applications feel and function. Navigation, toolbars, layouts, and patterns for building complete interfaces that compose Global tier primitives into higher-level structures.

## Package

<PackageInfo
  name="@canonical/react-ds-app"
  version="0.11.0"
  tier="apps"
  framework="react"
  status="prerelease"
  dependencies={["@canonical/styles"]}
  links={{
    source: "https://github.com/canonical/pragma/tree/main/packages/react/ds-app",
    ontology: "https://github.com/canonical/design-system",
  }}
/>

## Architecture

Apps tier components compose Global tier primitives into higher-level application patterns. They understand application context like navigation state and layout regions.

```
@canonical/react-ds-global (dependency)
         ↓
@canonical/react-ds-app (this package)
         ↓
Your Application
```

## Components

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Component</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <th>Readiness</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Button</td><td>Extended button with app-specific behaviors</td><td>C</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This tier is under active development. Components are added as application patterns stabilize.

## When to Use Apps Tier

Use Apps tier components when building:

- Internal tools and dashboards
- Developer-facing applications
- Complex navigation structures
- File management interfaces

For marketing sites, landing pages, or documentation, prefer Global tier components directly.

## Installation

```bash
bun add @canonical/react-ds-app
```

Requires `@canonical/react-ds-global` as a peer dependency.
