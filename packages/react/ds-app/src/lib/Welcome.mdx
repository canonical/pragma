# Apps Tier — React

Application-level components for building Canonical web applications. Navigation, toolbars, file browsers, and structural patterns that compose Global tier primitives into complete application interfaces.

## Architecture

Apps tier sits above Global, composing foundational components into higher-level application patterns:

```
@canonical/react-ds-global (dependency)
         ↓
@canonical/react-ds-app (this package)
         ↓
Your Application
```

## Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Button** | Extended button with app-specific behaviors |

This tier is under active development. Components are added as application patterns stabilize.

## When to Use Apps Tier

Use Apps tier components when building:

- Internal tools and dashboards
- Developer-facing applications
- Complex navigation structures
- File management interfaces

For marketing sites, landing pages, or documentation, prefer Global tier components directly.

## Installation

```bash
bun add @canonical/react-ds-app
```

Requires `@canonical/react-ds-global` as a peer dependency.
