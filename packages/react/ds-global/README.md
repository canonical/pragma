# @canonical/react-ds-global

Universal React components for the Pragma design system. This package provides foundational UI elements that apply across all Canonical web applications: buttons, badges, cards, tooltips, and more.

## Prerequisites

- React 19 or higher

## Installation

```bash
bun add @canonical/react-ds-global
```

The package depends on `@canonical/styles` for CSS.

## Usage

Import components by name:

```tsx
import { Button, Badge, Card, Tooltip } from "@canonical/react-ds-global";

function Example() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Badge>New</Badge>
      <Tooltip content="Click to submit">
        <Button appearance="positive">Submit</Button>
      </Tooltip>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

Components accept standard HTML attributes for their underlying elements. A `Button` accepts all `ButtonHTMLAttributes`, a `Link` accepts all `AnchorHTMLAttributes`, and so on.

## Modifier Families

Several components accept appearance props that correspond to modifier families from `@canonical/ds-types`:

```tsx
<Button appearance="positive">Confirm</Button>
<Button appearance="negative">Delete</Button>
<Button appearance="caution">Proceed with caution</Button>
```

The modifier classes integrate with CSS custom properties defined in `@canonical/styles`.

## Styles

Import the main styles package in your application entry point:

```tsx
import "@canonical/styles";
```

## Storybook

Each component includes Storybook stories demonstrating usage patterns and variants:

```bash
cd packages/react/ds-global
bun run storybook
```

Component specifications are defined in the [Design System Ontology](https://github.com/canonical/design-system).
