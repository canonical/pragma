# Apps/WPE Tier — React

Launchpad-specific components for Canonical's software collaboration platform. File trees, diff viewers, markdown editors, and UI patterns tailored to code hosting and bug tracking workflows.

## Architecture

The WPE (Web & Platform Engineering) tier extends Apps with product-specific functionality:

```
@canonical/react-ds-global (dependency)
         ↓
@canonical/react-ds-app (dependency)
         ↓
@canonical/react-ds-app-launchpad (this package)
         ↓
Launchpad Application
```

Components in this tier understand Launchpad's data models and may not be suitable for general use.

## Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **DiffChangeMarker** | Line-level diff annotations |
| **EditableBlock** | Inline editable content regions |
| **FileTree** | Hierarchical file browser |
| **GitDiffViewer** | Side-by-side and unified diff display |
| **MarkdownEditor** | Rich markdown editing with preview |
| **RelativeTime** | Human-readable time distances |

## Domain Context

Components understand Launchpad concepts:

| Domain | Components handle... |
|--------|---------------------|
| Code hosting | Branches, diffs, file hierarchies |
| Bug tracking | Status indicators, importance levels |
| Collaboration | Comments, merge proposals |
| Time | Relative timestamps, activity feeds |

## FileTree

Navigate directory structures with expand/collapse and selection:

```tsx
import { FileTree } from "@canonical/react-ds-app-launchpad";

<FileTree
  data={directoryStructure}
  onSelect={handleFileSelect}
  expandedPaths={["src", "src/components"]}
/>
```

## GitDiffViewer

Display code changes with syntax highlighting:

```tsx
import { GitDiffViewer } from "@canonical/react-ds-app-launchpad";

<GitDiffViewer
  diff={unifiedDiff}
  mode="split"
  language="typescript"
/>
```

## Installation

```bash
bun add @canonical/react-ds-app-launchpad
```

Requires `@canonical/react-ds-app` as a peer dependency.
